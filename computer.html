<p align="center">
A computer is an electronic machine that collects information,<br> 
stores it, processes it according to user instructions, and<br>
then returns the result.<br>

<p>
A computer is a programmable electronic device that performs<br> 
arithmetic and logical operations automatically using a set<br> 
of instructions provided by the user.<br>

<p id="Early_Computing_Devices"> <h1 align="left"> Early 
Computing Devices </h1></p>
<p align="center">
People used sticks, stones, and bones as counting tools <br>
before computers were invented. More computing devices <br>
were produced as technology advanced and the human <br>
intellect improved over time. Let us look at a few of <br>
the early-age computing devices used by mankind.<br>
</p><br>
<br><p id="Abacus"> <h1 align="left"> Abacus </h1></p>
<p align="center">
	Abacus was invented by the Chinese around 4000 years<br>
	ago. It�s a wooden rack with metal rods with beads <br>
	attached to them. The abacus operator moves the beads <br>
	according to certain guidelines to complete arithmetic <br>
	computations.<br>

<br>
<br><p id="Napier�s_Bone"> <h1 align="left"> Napier�s Bone </h1> </p><br>
<p align="center">
John Napier devised Napier�s Bones, a manually operated <br>
calculating apparatus. For calculating, this instrument <br>
used 9 separate ivory strips (bones) marked with numerals <br>
to multiply and divide. It was also the first machine <br>
to calculate using the decimal point system.<br>

<p id="Pascaline"> <h1 align="left"> Pascaline </h1> </p>
Pascaline was invented in 1642 by Biaise Pascal, a French <br>
mathematician and philosopher. It is thought to be the <br>
first mechanical and automated calculator. It was a wooden <br>
box with gears and wheels inside.<br>
<br>
<p id="Stepped_Reckoner_or_Leibniz_wheel"> <h1 align="left"> Stepped Reckoner or Leibniz wheel </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
In 1673, a German mathematician-philosopher named Gottfried <br>
Wilhelm Leibniz improved on Pascal�s invention to create <br>
this apparatus. It was a digital mechanical calculator known <br>
as the stepped reckoner because it used fluted drums instead <br>
of gears.<br>

<p id="Difference_Engine"> <h1 align="left"> Difference Engine </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
In the early 1820s, Charles Babbage created the Difference <br>
Engine. It was a mechanical computer that could do basic <br>
computations. It was a steam-powered calculating machine <br>
used to solve numerical tables such as logarithmic tables.<br>
</p>

<p id="Analytical_Engine "> <h1 align="left"> Analytical Engine  </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
Charles Babbage created another calculating machine, the <br>
Analytical Engine, in 1830. It was a mechanical computer <br>
that took input from punch cards. It was capable of solving <br>
any mathematical problem and storing data in an indefinite <br>
memory.<br>
</p>


<p id="Tabulating_machine "> <h1 align="left"> Tabulating machine  </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
An American Statistician � Herman Hollerith invented this <br>
machine in the year 1890. Tabulating Machine was a punch <br>
card-based mechanical tabulator. It could compute statistics <br>
and record or sort data or information. Hollerith began <br>
manufacturing these machines in his company, which ultimately <br>
became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.<br>

<p id=" Differential_Analyzer  "> <h1 align="left">  Differential Analyzer   </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
Vannevar Bush introduced the first electrical computer, the <br>
Differential Analyzer, in 1930. This machine is made up of <br>
vacuum tubes that switch electrical impulses in order to do <br>
calculations. It was capable of performing 25 calculations <br>
in a matter of minutes.<br>
</p>


<p id="Mark_I"> <h1 align="left"> Mark I </h1> </p>
<p align="center">
Howard Aiken planned to build a machine in 1937 that could <br>
conduct massive calculations or calculations using enormous <br>
numbers. The Mark I computer was constructed in 1944 as a <br>
collaboration between IBM and Harvard.<br>
